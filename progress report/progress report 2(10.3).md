## progress report 2 (10.3 TA course)

### Goals
* Run the sound part and humidity part code respectively
* Perfect the project ideas

### Questions
We have several questions about sensors. One is after we running the code, but all results it measured is zero. After meeting Bingqing, we found that the humidity and temperature sensor is broken.

Then we discussed about the sound sensor part with Bingqing. She recommended to use sound detect sensor to measure the different frequency of different music sound(like guitar, piano and so on). However, we found that the sound sensors in sensor kit is binary, which means it could only detect the sound or no sound. Hence, to make our project more fancy, we decided to use several color LEDs to detect the sound and to light these LEDs with different frequency with music sound. Then we fixed the code in sound part to adjust them to the perfect state with music sound.
