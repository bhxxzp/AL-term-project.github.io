## progress report 4(10.10)
### Goals
* Assemble model;
* Discussed the timeline and division of work
* Make initial video

### Questions
The initial system is a little bit disordered because of lots of power line. Hence, we put all lines and sensors in order. In this case, we have a clear logic to descript the set up and a more clear pattern to make video.
