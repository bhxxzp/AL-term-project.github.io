### Goals
* Assemble model;
* Discussed the timeline and division of work
* Make initial video

### Questions
The initial system is a little bit disordered because of lots of power line. Hence, we put all lines and sensors in order. In this case, we have a clear logic to descript the set up and a more clear pattern to make video.

In addition, we added some stuff to make the model much more fancy and more like a bathroom.  We also fixed the sensors and power lines at the right place in the box to make the whole model much more visualized.
