### Goals
* Join the Channel Relay Module and ventilating fans to humidity part.
* Run the sound part code and humidity part code at the same time

### Progress
After we change our humidity and temperature sensors to an unbroken one, we ran the code and tested the humidity part. Then we join the Channel Relay Module and the ventilating fans to the Raspberry Pi. The function is to control the fansâ€™ state through measuring the humidity value to the code. 
Next, we managed to use four separate screens in Raspberry Pi to run the code at the same time.
